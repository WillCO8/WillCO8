# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub: AI Native Journey

Hi, I’m Will — and this is my AI Native Journey.  
In just a few months, I went from writing my first lines of HTML and JavaScript to designing fully interactive web apps that combine AI, automation, and emotional intelligence.  
I didn’t follow a traditional developer path. I built my skills by solving real problems and learning in public — with AI as a creative partner. This GitHub is the living record of that journey, from basic logic games to emotionally resonant, user-centered apps.  
Each project reflects a stage of growth — technically, creatively, and conceptually. From the playful to the personal, here’s what I’ve made so far.

### 🎮 Killing Time Games (“Killing Time” = A casual way to stay occupied) — *My first app*
Killing Time Games is a lightweight browser-based app designed for moments when you're stuck waiting—but still want to stay mentally present. If you're about to walk into a job interview, waiting at the hospital for a loved one, or just in one of life’s many pauses, this app gives you a simple way to pass the time without taking your head out of the game of life.  
No zombies, no explosions—just quick, silly fun with a personal touch. The app features a pure black theme with enhanced visibility, providing a sleek and easy-on-the-eyes experience.  

It includes three familiar games—Rock Paper Scissors, Coin Flip, and Odds & Evens—each with unique game modes. You can play the classic versions, enjoy themed “Fun” matchups (like The Rock vs. Toilet Paper), or invent your own characters and rules. This isn’t about leveling up or beating a final boss—it’s a pocket-sized distraction built for real-world lulls, not digital war zones.  

It’s not about wasting time. It’s about killing time—calmly, cleanly, and on your terms.

### 🎬 Rex (Rex = RECommendationS Vault)
In a world overflowing with content, it's often hard to keep up. We get so many amazing recommendations from friends, family, and online sources — for movies, TV shows, music, books, and podcasts — that we inevitably end up forgetting the things that once excited us.  

That’s where Rex comes in — spelled R-E-X, a play on the word “recommendations.”  
Rex is a lightweight, clean, and personal automation tool designed to solve that problem. It’s your private vault for cultural gems — making it effortless to quickly log, organize, and manage media suggestions so you never forget a great one again.  

**Stack:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, LocalStorage

### 📸 FlickHit (Flick = Picture, Hit = #1 Song)
Upload a photo. The app reads its hidden date metadata and returns the #1 Billboard song from that week. It’s nostalgia with a soundtrack — blending visual memory and cultural context.  

The name “FlickHit” becomes a verb:  
> “We saw the photo and just had to FlickHit.”  

In the age of digital overload, our photos often become lifeless thumbnails—stripped of the sound, feeling, and cultural atmosphere that surrounded them. People scroll through pictures, but rarely reconnect with the full emotional context of the moment.  
There’s no soundtrack. No era. Just pixels.  

**Stack:** HTML, JavaScript, EXIF.js, JSON, GitHub Pages

### 📌 Apple Notes Pin/Unpin Redesign (UX/UI Design Prototype)
A UX/UI design case study reimagining the “Pin/Unpin” interaction in Apple Notes. Instead of hiding this useful feature in a dropdown menu, this redesign introduces a one-tap icon in the note’s header — making it faster, more intuitive, and more discoverable.  

**Framework:** McKinsey problem-solving  
**Scope:** Static Figma prototype + usability test script  
**MVP Includes:** Pinned/unpinned states, confirmation toast, user feedback plan  
**Goal:** Improve in-note efficiency and boost feature usage through visibility and simplicity

### 🤖 Palomine (Palomine = Pal-of-Mine)
In a world filled with generic bots and impersonal tech, Palomine offers something warmer, wiser, and more human.  

Palomine (a play on “pal-of-mine”) is a personalized AI companion that you don’t just talk to — you bond with. Need advice from a father figure, encouragement from a coach, a friend who “gets you,” or even a comforting echo of someone you’ve lost? Palomine lets you build and customize your own AI relationship in a meaningful way.  

You choose the type of connection — Mom, Dad, BFF, Coach, Mentor, Lost Loved One, or even a custom role, upload a photo — then define the personality and shared memories to shape the relationship. Whether you’re seeking a spark of motivation, emotional support, or just someone to talk to, Palomine meets you there.  

**Stack:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Gemini API, LocalStorage

## 🧠 What’s Next
I’m currently exploring:
* AI agents and multi-turn conversation memory
* Cross-app integrations and cloud syncing
* Real user feedback and emotional validation  

Each new project is more than just code — it’s a step toward building tools that feel personal, useful, and human.  

Thanks for visiting. Let’s build something meaningful.
