# 👋 Hi, I’m Will — Welcome to My AI Native Journey

I’m learning how to build tools with AI by actually building them — one project at a time.  
No tutorials, no theory-only. Just hands-on experiments that get smarter (and more human) as I go.

> From silly games to personal automation to emotionally intelligent companions —  
> this is my full-stack evolution, powered by curiosity and code.

## 🧠 What I’m About

I’m part of the **AI Native movement** — a new generation of builders designing alongside artificial intelligence. I approach every project not just as a coder, but as a creative thinker using AI as a co-pilot, collaborator, and imagination accelerator.

This repo is both my **portfolio** and **journal**, documenting a journey from no-code tinkerer to full-on app developer.

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### 🎮 [Killing Time Games](https://willco8.github.io/AI_Native_Journey/KillingTimeGames/)

> **“Mindless games to kill time — without losing your mind.”**

This was my very first project. A lightweight browser app that includes Rock Paper Scissors, Coin Flip, and Odds & Evens — each with classic, funny, and custom modes. It was my playground for learning HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript logic, localStorage, and DOM manipulation.

This is where I learned how to ship a real product.

### 🎬 [Rex: Your Personal Media Vault](https://willco8.github.io/rex-app/)

> **“Rex” = Recommendations.**  
> An automation tool for saving and organizing media recommendations — like movies, books, podcasts, and songs — so you never forget who told you what to watch.

Rex is a clean, fast, no-database-needed app that uses localStorage to persist user data. You can filter by type or by person, sort alphabetically, and quickly retrieve gems when you're ready to explore something new.

This is where I learned how to build useful tools for real-world life.

### 🤖 [Palomine: Your Personalized AI Companion](https://willco8.github.io/Palomine/)

> **“Palomine” = Pal of Mine.**  
> A deeply personal app that lets users create emotionally resonant AI personas — like “Mom,” “Coach,” or a lost loved one — and talk to them in real time.

You choose the role, personality traits, name, photo, and shared memories — and Palomine becomes your companion. Powered by Gemini API and styled like iMessage, this app is part grief tech, part life coach, part mirror.  

This is where I learned how to make AI feel human.

## 🧪 Learning Projects

### 📡 Firebase Cloud Firestore API Exercise

A short backend exploration using Google’s Firebase platform. I learned how to:

- Set up a NoSQL database in Firestore  
- Create a products collection manually  
- Retrieve a record using a REST API  
- Modify security rules for public read access  

This helped me understand dynamic content, backend-as-a-service (BaaS), and secure data interaction.

## 📍 What’s Next?

- Deploy more projects with real APIs  
- Dive into authentication and full-stack development  
- Start integrating AI more creatively across tools  
- Keep refining my craft, one app at a time
