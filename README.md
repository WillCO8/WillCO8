# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub: AI Native Journey

Hi, I’m Will — and this is my AI Native Journey.

In just a few months, I went from writing my first lines of HTML and JavaScript to designing fully interactive web apps that combine AI, automation, and emotional intelligence.

I didn’t follow a traditional developer path. I built my skills by solving real problems and learning in public — with AI as a creative partner. This GitHub is the living record of that journey, from basic logic games to emotionally resonant, user-centered apps.

Each project reflects a stage of growth — technically, creatively, and conceptually. From the playful to the personal, here’s what I’ve made so far:

---

## 🎮 Killing Time Games _(“Killing Time” = A casual way to stay occupied)_

**Live App:** [Play Now](https://willco8.github.io/AI_Native_Journey/KillingTimeGames/)

My first app.  A suite of mini-games — Rock Paper Scissors, Coin Flip, Odds & Evens — designed for light mental distraction in real-world waiting moments (e.g., at the DMV or hospital). Includes personalized player names, fun modes (e.g., The Rock vs. Toilet Paper), and custom matchup memory.

**Stack:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, LocalStorage

---

## 🎬 Rex _(Rex = RECommendationS Vault)_

**Live App:** [Rex App](https://willco8.github.io/rex-app/)

Too many podcasts, books, shows, and songs get lost in the void. Rex is a clean, local-storage-powered media vault that lets you instantly log, filter, and sort your cultural recommendations — by type, title, or who recommended it.

**Stack:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, LocalStorage

## 📸 FlickHit _(Flick = Picture, Hit = #1 Song)_

**Live App:** [FlickHit](https://willco8.github.io/AI_Native_Journey/FlickHit/)

Upload a photo. The app reads its hidden date metadata and returns the #1 Billboard song from that week. It’s nostalgia with a soundtrack — blending visual memory and cultural context. The name “FlickHit” becomes a verb:  
> “We saw the photo and just had to FlickHit it.”

**Stack:** HTML, JavaScript, EXIF.js, JSON, GitHub Pages

## 📌 Apple Notes Pin/Unpin Redesign _(UX/UI Design Prototype)_

**Live Prototype:** [View Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/make/WwxkA9J5atwMjfCTjaYoi2/Apple-Notes-Pin-Unpin-Redesign?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=Brabhwa47nAekSQU-0&fullscreen=1)

A UX/UI design case study reimagining the “Pin/Unpin” interaction in Apple Notes. Instead of hiding this useful feature in a dropdown menu, this redesign introduces a one-tap icon in the note’s header — making it faster, more intuitive, and more discoverable.

**Framework:** McKinsey problem-solving  
**Scope:** Static Figma prototype + usability test script  
**MVP Includes:** Pinned/unpinned states, confirmation toast, user feedback plan  
**Goal:** Improve in-note efficiency and boost feature usage through visibility and simplicity

## 🤖 Palomine _(Palomine = Pal-of-Mine)_

**Live App:** [Coming Soon](https://willco8.github.io/AI_Native_Journey/Palomine/)

A personalized AI companion you don’t just chat with — you bond with. Create a “Mom,” “Coach,” or even a lost loved one with custom traits, photos, and shared memories. Chat threads are private, persistent, and emotionally aligned using Gemini AI.

**Stack:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, Gemini API, LocalStorage

---

## 🧪 Firebase Cloud Firestore API Demo _(Learning Project)_

**Repo:** [Firebase API Exercise](https://github.com/willco8/firebase-firestore-api-exercise)

A hands-on learning project to understand how frontend apps interact with NoSQL databases via REST APIs. I set up a Firestore database in test mode, added data manually, then retrieved specific documents using secure API calls.

**Stack:** Firebase, REST API, JSON

---

## 🧠 What’s Next

I’m currently exploring:

- AI agents and multi-turn conversation memory  
- Cross-app integrations and cloud syncing  
- Real user feedback and emotional validation

Each new project is more than just code — it’s a step toward building tools that feel personal, useful, and human.

Thanks for visiting.  
Let’s build something meaningful.
