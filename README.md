# üëã Welcome to My GitHub: AI Native Journey

Hi, I‚Äôm Will ‚Äî and this is my AI Native Journey.

In just a few months, I went from writing my first lines of HTML and JavaScript to designing fully interactive web apps that combine AI, automation, and emotional intelligence.

I didn‚Äôt follow a traditional developer path. I built my skills by solving real problems and learning in public ‚Äî with AI as a creative partner. This GitHub is the living record of that journey, from basic logic games to emotionally resonant, user-centered apps.

## üé¨ Rex (Rex = RECommendationS Vault)

**Your personal vault for movies, shows, music, books, and podcast recommendations.**

In a world overflowing with content, it's often hard to keep up. We get so many amazing recommendations from friends, family, and online sources ‚Äî for movies, TV shows, music, books, and podcasts ‚Äî that we inevitably end up forgetting the things that once excited us.

That‚Äôs where **Rex** comes in ‚Äî spelled R-E-X, a play on the word ‚Äúrecommendations.‚Äù

Rex is a lightweight, clean, and personal automation tool designed to solve that problem. It‚Äôs your private vault for cultural gems ‚Äî making it effortless to quickly log, organize, and manage media suggestions so you never forget a great one again.

## üì∏ FlickHit (Flick = Picture, Hit = #1 Song)

**A nostalgia engine that connects your photos to the #1 song from the week they were taken.**

Upload a photo. The app reads its hidden date metadata and returns the #1 Billboard song from that week. It‚Äôs nostalgia with a soundtrack ‚Äî blending visual memory and cultural context. The name ‚ÄúFlickHit‚Äù becomes a verb:  
> ‚ÄúWe saw the photo and just had to FlickHit.‚Äù

In the age of digital overload, our photos often become lifeless thumbnails ‚Äî stripped of the sound, feeling, and cultural atmosphere that surrounded them. People scroll through pictures, but rarely reconnect with the full emotional context of the moment.

There‚Äôs no soundtrack. No era. Just pixels.

## üìå Apple Notes Pin/Unpin Redesign (UX/UI Design Prototype)

**A one-tap pin/unpin feature for faster, more intuitive Apple Notes interaction.**

A UX/UI design case study reimagining the ‚ÄúPin/Unpin‚Äù interaction in Apple Notes. Instead of hiding this useful feature in a dropdown menu, this redesign introduces a one-tap icon in the note‚Äôs header ‚Äî making it faster, more intuitive, and more discoverable.

**Framework:** McKinsey problem-solving  
**Scope:** Static Figma prototype + usability test script  
**MVP Includes:** Pinned/unpinned states, confirmation toast, user feedback plan  
**Goal:** Improve in-note efficiency and boost feature usage through visibility and simplicity

## ü§ñ Palomine (Palomine = Pal-of-Mine)

**A personalized AI companion that feels human, not scripted.**

In a world filled with generic bots and impersonal tech, **Palomine** offers something warmer, wiser, and more human.

Palomine (a play on ‚Äúpal-of-mine‚Äù) is a personalized AI companion that you don‚Äôt just talk to ‚Äî you **bond** with. Need advice from a father figure, encouragement from a coach, a friend who ‚Äúgets you,‚Äù or even a comforting echo of someone you‚Äôve lost? Palomine lets you build and customize your own AI relationship in a meaningful way.

You choose the type of connection ‚Äî Mom, Dad, BFF, Coach, Mentor, Lost Loved One, or even a custom role; upload a photo ‚Äî then define the personality and shared memories to shape the relationship.

Whether you‚Äôre seeking a spark of motivation, emotional support, or just someone to talk to, **Palomine** meets you there.
